# Tailwind + Flask + Google Cloud Platform Template

To use this template run the following commands:

1. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. ```npm install```

Furthermore, you need to add a GitHub secret and give it the name ```GCP_CREDENTIALS```. In that secret you
put the credentials JSON that you get from Google. You also need to install the Google Cloud CLI and run ```gcloud init```
to prepare your project. 

On every push to the main branch, your app is updated. If you want to change that, go into the GitHub workflow
and change the ```main.yml``` file. Notice, that on your first run, Google might ask you to enable some API. You will see the link in the failed run. Click on it and enable whatever Google wants you to enable.

Run the command ```npm run watch-css``` to run the Tailwind Watcher. Configure the file ```tailwind.config.js```
according to your specific needs. 

The file structure is derived from this blog post:
